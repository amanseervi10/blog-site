# blog-site
This is a blogging website where people can share their ideas.

## Technologies Used
This website uses the MERN stack, i.e Node, Express for the backend, [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database and [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend.

Authentication is done using JWT (using [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken))

For uploading images I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

## Deployment

The back end is deployed using [Render](https://render.com/) and the react application using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

# The site is hosted [here](https://cheap-blog-site.netlify.app/)
